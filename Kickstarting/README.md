# Kickstarting Project

The repository replicates the reinforcement learning [_paper_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03835.pdf) of Google Deepmind published in March 2018. While the experiments of the original paper are done on the [_DMLab-30_](https://github.com/deepmind/lab) task suite, we implement this method for gym games only.


## Description of the kickstarting method

Kickstarting is a method for using previously-trained ‘teacher’ agents to kickstart the training of a new ‘student’ agent.
